# You have to do systemctl restart libvirt, or if your using runit, download runit versions of all the packages
# There are multiple daemons required to allow virt-manager to work properly. If you set everything up,
# and only see LXC avaliable its because you have to go File > Add Connection in virt-manager  and add QEMU & KVM.

# Need to put 'firewall_backend = "iptables" in /etc/libvirt/network.conf otherwise internet will not work on VM'
